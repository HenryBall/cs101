Algorithms and Abstract Data Types

pa1: Uses a doubly linked list indexed by a cursor to indirectly sort an array of strings using a variation of insertion sort

pa2: Implements pa1 in C

pa3: Uses the linked list created in pa1 to create a sparse matrix calculator

pa4: Uses the linked list created in pa1 to create a graph ADT and implemets BFS to determine distances and shortest paths between nodes of a given graph

pa5: Uses the linked list created in pa1 to create a digraph ADT and implemets DFS to determine the strongly connected components of a given digraph
